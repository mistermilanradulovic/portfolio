    "description": "I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer with {{years}} years of hands-on experience building web applications that actually work — and work well. I've delivered solutions for global companies across entertainment, fintech, and SaaS, always with a focus on clean code, real performance, and great user experience. I work well with international teams, communicate clearly, and genuinely care about the product, not just the code. In my free time, I occasionally fly small aircraft as a hobby — it helps me stay focused and reminds me that precision matters.",
